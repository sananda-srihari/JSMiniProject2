# JSMiniProject2

For my second week project, I'm creating a basic library book management application using JavaScript. The application will allow users to add and remove books from a library, as well as search for books by title or author. I'll be implementing features such as adding and removing books from a library, as well as a simple user interface. By the end of the week, I aim to have a functional application that demonstrates my understanding of basic JavaScript and web development principles.
